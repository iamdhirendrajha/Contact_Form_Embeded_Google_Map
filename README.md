📍 Contact Form with Embedded Google Map

This is a simple HTML-only project that includes a Contact Form and an Embedded Google Map.
It allows users to enter their name, email, and message, and view your office/location on Google Maps — all without using CSS, JavaScript, or backend code.

🧾 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

* Create a clean HTML contact form with input fields and textarea.

* Embed a Google Map iframe for displaying a specific location.

* Add essential HTML meta tags for SEO, and  responsive design.

* Use mailto in the form’s action attribute to send messages directly via email client (no backend required).

🧱 Features

✅ Pure HTML — no CSS or JS

✅ Fully responsive on mobile (via meta viewport)

✅ SEO-optimized meta tags (title, description, keywords, author)

✅ Embedded Google Map with customizable location

✅ mailto: form submission option

🧠 How It Works

* User fills the form with their name, email, and message.

* When they click Send Message, their default email app opens (like Gmail or Outlook) with the form data.

* The Google Map iframe displays your address or any location you choose.
